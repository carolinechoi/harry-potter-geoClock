# Harry Potter Geo-Clock

"But she may already know, that excellent clock of hers." 
— Albus Dumbledore on the Weasley's clock

Modeled after the famous Weasley family clock, this “Harry Potter Clock” uses geo-location and geo-fencing services to locate family and friends. With the help and support of UC Berkeley's Society of Women Engineers (SWE), I finished the project over the span of four days (hackathon-style!) and was invited to present it in a showcase at the university's Sibley Auditorium.

We used a particle photon for the hardware, and a mix of C++ and IFTT (an installable mobile app) dependencies for software. Also, we kind of had a budget of $25, hence the unpolished appearnace.
